Provision Enviorment With Shell Script
Very simple vagrant file with shell script provisioning.
We will be installing apache2 using shell script. So we don't have to manually install and link the /var/www to shared folder /vargrant.

/vagrant is share from your host machine. It will be there even you destroy the guest vagrant.
